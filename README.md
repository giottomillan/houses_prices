This repository contains code and data for training a machine learning model to predict house prices. The model is built using Python and several popular data science libraries.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the price of a house based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, etc. We utilize a dataset that includes historical house prices and their attributes to train our model.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains several features including but not limited to:
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Square footage
- Lot size
- Year built
- Location (zip code)
